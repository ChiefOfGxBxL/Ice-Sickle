**I want to help develop**
Awesome! We welcome contributions from the WC3 community. There are many ways you can help us, so figure out what works for you!

Things you can help with
 * Coding - If you're good with JavaScript and web development, we build Ice Sickle on top of Electron. Follow the instructions below to get the source code and get to work!
 * Plugins - You can add new functionality to the editor without modifying the core code. This is done through our plugin API.
 * Identify and squash bugs - Find something that's broken or could use improvement? Submit an issue.
 * Documentation - A very important part of developing this project, our documentation covers concepts core to the repository, but also includes tutorials and walkthroughs for using the editor and making plugins.
