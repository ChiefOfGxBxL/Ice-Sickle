Command line for map extraction/bundling

I've been using Ladik's MPQ editor as a UI to extract files from a .w3x map file, such as the war3map.doo, .j file, etc. And it's also possible to use this tool to overwrite those files with modifications one has made.

But is there any command line tool to "bundle" or "zip" up a .w3x map file from a bunch of its components? For instance, I have several of the war3map.* files that I want to zip up to make a map. What I'm interested is doing this programatically instead of having to drag and drop the modified files in by hand.
